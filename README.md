# Dictionary Program

## Overview
This project is a Python program that allows users to search for the definitions of words from a dictionary stored in a JSON file. It includes features like case-insensitive word search, handling of misspellings by suggesting similar words, and error handling when a word is not found.

## Features
- Load word definitions from a JSON file.
- Search for word definitions in a case-insensitive manner (e.g., `Rain`, `rain`, `RAIN`).
- Suggest the closest matching word if the user enters a misspelled word using the `difflib` library.
- Handle errors if a word is not in the dictionary by returning an appropriate message.

## How to Run the Program
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your machine.
2. Download or clone the project files.
3. Navigate to the project folder in your terminal:
   ```bash
   cd dictionary_project
Run the program:
python dictionary.py
Input a word to search for its definition.

Example Usage
Input:
Enter a word: rain
Output:
Water that falls from the sky.
Input:
Enter a word: pott
Output:
Did you mean 'pot'? Definition: A container used for cooking or storing food.
Extending the Dictionary
To add more words to the dictionary, simply modify the dictionary.json file. Add new entries in the following format:

{
    "new_word": "Definition of the new word"
}
For example:
{
    "python": "A high-level programming language used for general-purpose programming.",
    "ocean": "A large body of saltwater that covers most of Earth's surface."
}
